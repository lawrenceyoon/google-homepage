<h1>Google HomePage Look-A-Like</h1>
<p>A project I made from The Odin Project</p>

<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>This current project is about making a Google look-a-like. I can use the images, this is just a practice for responsive web design and getting everything placed similarly to Google's homepage. </p>

<h2>What I used/learned</h2>
<p>I used flexbox as well as position properties in CSS to achieve my results. I then added in different breakpoints to make sure the page had a consistent flow. I wasn't sure how to create the three svg images (magnifying glass & voice from the input bar, as well as the 9 dots in the nav), so I got them from TarekVisch, who provided them in his code. I got the other images from the actual google website and used the position property to align all of these as close to the normal Google site as possible. This was a great practice for both honing my css skills and learning more about flexbox for positioning.</p>
